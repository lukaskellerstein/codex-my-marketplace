# demo-video-plugin

Turns a project repo into a narrated, edited demo video.

Reads the codebase → writes a storyboard with real narrative value → prepares deterministic
app state → drives the UI with Playwright and records one clip per section (web **and**
Electron, recorded by Playwright or by **OBS**) → generates ElevenLabs voiceover → reconciles
*measured* durations into a timeline → renders the final cut with Remotion, or exports it as a
**Final Cut Pro** project.

```
$demo-setup                 # once per machine: ffmpeg, Playwright, Remotion, API key, OBS, FCP
$demo-video                 # then describe it: "90s demo of semantic search, for
                            #   engineering leads evaluating us"
```

(Everything is a skill — invoke by `$name`, or just ask for a demo video and the
`demo-video` skill triggers on its own.)

## Design

Two decisions do most of the work.

**JSON contracts, not improvisation.** Codex writes `storyboard.json`; deterministic scripts
measure media and compute the edit; a bundled, timeline-driven Remotion project renders it.
Codex never hand-writes editing code for a standard demo, so output does not depend on it
reinventing React each run.

**Audio-led, measured timeline.** Narration is generated *before* the recorded take, and its
measured duration is the authoritative length of each section — the way a human editor cuts
picture to voice. Nothing in the pipeline trusts a planned duration: Playwright's VP8 WebM
is fixed at 25fps with an unreliable container duration and poor seek behaviour in Remotion,
so every clip is transcoded to H.264 MP4 at the composition fps and probed, and every
narration file is probed too.

Plus one rule that removes most agent-driven capture failures: **never record the first take.**
Rehearse unrecorded, then record.

And two separations that keep the pipeline honest about quality:

- **Who drives the app is separate from what records it.** Playwright drives; Playwright video
  *or* OBS records. OBS captures the real window at native pixels and 60 fps, so text stays
  readable, and it pauses through long waits so an agent run does not fill the clip.
- **The cut is separate from the finish.** One reconciled timeline renders headlessly in
  Remotion *or* exports as a Final Cut Pro project for hand-finishing with FCP's titles.

## Pipeline

```
$demo-video → preflight → research → storyboard →【GATE 1: narrative】
      → app prep → rehearse →【GATE 2: feasible】
      → voiceover (measured) → record (budgeted to the voice; Playwright or OBS)
      → reconcile → draft render →【GATE 3: watch it】→ review
      → final render (Remotion) and/or FCPXML → finished by hand in Final Cut Pro
```

Stages are individually re-runnable — in practice one section is re-cut several times while
the rest stays untouched.

## Skills

Every stage is a skill: it triggers on a matching request, or invoke it directly as
`$<skill-name>`.

| Skill | Owns |
|---|---|
| `demo-video` | The pipeline, artifact contracts, gates. The entry point — load before touching `demo/`. |
| `demo-setup` | Doctor + installer for the toolchain; scaffolds `demo/` |
| `demo-scripting` | Narrative: what earns screen time, beat structure, pacing math, narration writing |
| `demo-app-prep` | Deterministic, demo-worthy app state — seeding, frozen clocks, hidden dev UI, isolated desktop-app state |
| `demo-capture` | Cinematography, drivers (MCP, launch, attach) and recorders (Playwright, OBS, ffmpeg) |
| `demo-voiceover` | Voice/model selection, fitting a line to a duration, captions, music |
| `demo-assembly` | Reconciliation rules, the Remotion template, render presets, the Final Cut Pro export |
| `demo-review` | QA rubric, frame reading, routing findings back to the right stage |

## Subagents

| Subagent | Why isolated |
|---|---|
| `demo-researcher` | Reads the whole repo; returns a small ranked capability inventory |
| `demo-capture-operator` | One per section, **sequential** — Playwright snapshots are huge, the output is one clip |
| `demo-remotion-builder` | Custom compositions; render/typecheck loops are noisy |
| `demo-frame-critic` | Reads dozens of frames; returns a ranked findings list |

Storyboard and narration text stay in the main thread — they need whole-demo coherence.

## Hooks

Each one prevents a specific expensive failure.

| Trigger | Does |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Silent unless `demo/` exists; then reports missing tooling and which pipeline stage the artifacts are at |
| after `browser_stop_video` | Transcodes WebM → CFR H.264 MP4 and writes a measured duration sidecar |
| after `text_to_speech` | Probes the narration and warns when it is >20% off its budget |
| after writing `storyboard.json` | Shape + pacing + budget + filler-phrase validation (blocking) |
| after writing `timeline.json` | Media existence, duration match, gaps, warp limits (blocking) |

## Requirements

- **ffmpeg / ffprobe** — every transcode and measurement
- **Node ≥ 18** — scripts and Remotion
- **uvx** — runs the `demo-elevenlabs` MCP server
- **`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`**
- **Playwright browsers** — `npx playwright install chromium`
- **Remotion dependencies** — bundled in `demo/studio/package.json` and installed on first render.
  Optional agent skills for custom compositions: `npx skills add remotion-dev/skills`
- **`playwright` module** — for the script capture paths (launch, attach); `$demo-setup` installs it into
  `~/.cache/demo-video-plugin`
- **OBS 30+** (optional, for the OBS recorder) — WebSocket server enabled,
  `OBS_WEBSOCKET_PASSWORD` in the environment, Node ≥ 22 for the built-in WebSocket client
- **Final Cut Pro** (optional, for the FCP finish) — plus `xmllint`, which macOS ships

## MCP servers

| Server | Notes |
|---|---|
| `demo-playwright` | `@playwright/mcp` with **`--caps=devtools,vision,network,storage,testing`** (devtools gates the video tools; vision the coordinate mouse tools; network route-blocking; storage auth injection; testing the verify tools), headless, isolated, 1600×900, the cursor-overlay init script, and a dedicated temporary npm cache so MCP startup is not coupled to the user's npm-cache ownership |
| `demo-elevenlabs` | `uvx elevenlabs-mcp` for narration, voices, and music beds |

`demo-playwright` records at 1600×900 into a 1920×1080 composition on purpose: the 1.2×
upscale makes app text readable at normal playback sizes.

## Capture: drivers and recorders

`meta.capture` in the storyboard picks both:

| | Options |
|---|---|
| **driver** | `mcp` — the headless Playwright MCP (web) · `launch` — `capture-electron.mjs` starts the Electron app per section · `attach` — `capture-attached.mjs` attaches over CDP to an app already running on its own (isolated data, wrapper scripts, packaged builds) |
| **recorder** | `playwright` — VP8 at 25 fps · `obs` — the real window through obs-websocket, native pixels, 60 fps, pauses through waits · `ffmpeg` — `capture-screen-macos.sh`, last resort |

```bash
node scripts/obs.mjs status                                   # reachable? can it pause?
node scripts/obs.mjs setup-scene --window "My App" --size 1600x900
node scripts/capture-attached.mjs --project . --dry           # rehearse
node scripts/capture-attached.mjs --project . --section 03-ask
```

The script paths add actions the MCP cannot do: `setup` before recording, `in` to reach
targets through shadow roots and sandboxed iframes, `selectText`, `waitFor` with
`compress: "pause"` or `state: "hidden"`, and `input: "dom"` for windows real input does not
reach. Guides: `skills/demo-capture/references/obs.md` and `electron.md`.

## Finish: Remotion or Final Cut Pro

```bash
bash scripts/render.sh --final                                # Remotion -> demo/out/demo.mp4
node scripts/timeline-to-fcpxml.mjs --project .               # FCP      -> demo/out/demo.fcpxml
node scripts/fcp-templates.mjs --category "Lower Thirds"      # what meta.fcp can name
```

The FCPXML carries the same cut: clips with retimes and holds, cross dissolves, narration,
the ducked music bed, title cards and lower thirds on FCP's own Motion templates, captions and
chapter markers. It is validated against the installed FCP's DTD before anyone imports it.
Guide: `skills/demo-assembly/references/final-cut-pro.md`.

## Layout

```
demo/                       created in the target project
  brief.md  storyboard.json  prep/           [committed]
  capture/  audio/  timeline.json  out/      [gitignored, regenerable]
  prep/state/                                 [gitignored — isolated app state]
  studio/                    Remotion project, reads ../timeline.json
```

`brief.md` + `storyboard.json` + `prep/` rebuild the entire video.

## Notable details

- **Playwright records no mouse cursor, and OBS hides the OS one.** `assets/cursor-overlay.js`
  draws one that eases toward the real pointer — or is driven explicitly by the capture
  scripts, over iframes too — with a click ripple and a keystroke badge. Without it the video
  looks like a test run.
- **OBS lies about pausing.** `PauseRecord` answers success even when the output cannot pause,
  so the recorder waits for the `PAUSED` event and warns when it never comes.
- **Time-warp is capped at ±15%.** Beyond that the reconciler holds a frozen last frame under a
  continuing camera move rather than producing rubbery motion — and says so in its report.
- **A surface change forces a hard cut**, so web → desktop reads as intentional.
- **Captions are on by default**, because most demos are first watched muted.
- **The storyboard validator rejects demo filler** ("as you can see", "revolutionize") and
  unspeakable pacing.

## Extending

- Brand it: `demo/studio/src/lib/theme.ts` only.
- New section type: component + `Timeline.tsx` dispatch + the validator's `SURFACES` set.
- Ambitious compositions: the Remotion agent skills (`$remotion-markup`, `$remotion-captions`,
  `$remotion-docs`) via the `demo-remotion-builder` subagent.
- Different editorial house style: `scripts/reconcile.mjs` constants.

Keep the timeline contract — sections positioned by `startFrame`/`durationInFrames` — or the
measured pipeline stops controlling the cut.
