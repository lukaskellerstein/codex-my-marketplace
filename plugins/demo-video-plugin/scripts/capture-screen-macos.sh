# TIER 3 Electron fallback: OS-level screen capture on macOS.
#
# Use only when Playwright's Electron recordVideo produces empty files (a known issue on
# some Playwright/Electron combinations). Quality is lower than a real Playwright
# recording: the OS cursor is captured instead of the styled overlay, display scaling can
# soften text, and timing is less precise.
#
# Requires Screen Recording permission for the terminal running Codex:
#   System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
#
# usage: capture-screen-macos.sh --app "My App" --out demo/capture/07-native.webm --seconds 20
#        capture-screen-macos.sh --list        # show avfoundation devices
