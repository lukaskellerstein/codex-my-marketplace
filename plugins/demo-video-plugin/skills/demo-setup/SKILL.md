name: demo-setup
description: Checks and installs everything the demo-video pipeline needs — ffmpeg, Playwright browsers, bundled Remotion dependencies, uvx, and the ElevenLabs key, plus the optional OBS recorder (websocket reachable, able to pause) and Final Cut Pro finish — and scaffolds demo/ in the target project. Use before the first demo video on a machine, when any pipeline stage reports missing tooling, when MCP video tools are absent from /mcp, when OBS will not connect, or when the user asks to set up, doctor, or install the demo toolchain.

# Demo pipeline setup

Verify (and, when asked, install) the toolchain for demo videos.

## 1. Check first, always

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.sh
```

This changes nothing. It reports on: node ≥18, ffmpeg/ffprobe, uvx, Playwright browsers, an
importable `playwright` module for the script capture paths, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, whether
optional Remotion agent skills are present, and the two optional pieces: OBS (installed,
Node 22+, `OBS_WEBSOCKET_PASSWORD` set, the websocket answering, pausing possible) and Final
Cut Pro (installed, the newest FCPXML it imports, `xmllint`). The bundled studio installs its
own npm dependencies on first render.

Show the user the report.

## 2. Confirm before installing

If the user wants missing pieces installed, **show the exact commands first and ask**.
Some of them change state outside this project:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg                                          # system package
brew install uv                                              # system package
npx playwright install chromium                               # ~150MB download
npm install --prefix "$HOME/.cache/demo-video-plugin" playwright
npx skills add remotion-dev/skills                            # optional custom-composition skills
```

Then:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.sh --install
```

The Remotion agent skills are optional and used only for custom compositions beyond the bundled
template. Codex normally detects skill changes automatically; restart it if they do not appear.

## 3. Verify the MCP servers

Check that both servers declared by this plugin are connected, and specifically that the video
tools are available:

- `mcp__demo-playwright__browser_start_video`
- `mcp__demo-playwright__browser_stop_video`
- `mcp__demo-playwright__browser_video_chapter`
- `mcp__demo-elevenlabs__text_to_speech`

If the video tools are absent, recording is impossible. Check in order: is `demo-playwright`
connected; does its config include `--caps=devtools`; is `@playwright/mcp` recent
(`npx @playwright/mcp@latest --version`); was Codex restarted after install.

## 4. ElevenLabs key

`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` must be in the environment. If it is missing, tell the user where to put
it (shell profile or Codex environment settings) — do not write a key into the repo, and do not
echo a key that is already set.

If the key is present, `mcp__demo-elevenlabs__check_subscription` confirms it works and reports
remaining characters. Worth doing before a demo, since the whole narration is generated in one
pass.

## 5. OBS (optional — the crisp recorder)

Needed when a demo records with `meta.capture.recorder: "obs"`: desktop apps, and any demo
whose text must stay readable. None of it is installed or changed by `setup.sh`; the user does
the OBS side once, by hand:

1. `brew install --cask obs` — **ask first**, it is a system app.
2. OBS → Tools → WebSocket Server Settings → Enable. The password shown under "Show Connect
   Info" goes into the user's secret store and the environment as `OBS_WEBSOCKET_PASSWORD`.
   Never write it into the repo, never echo it, never pass it as a flag.
3. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → OBS.
4. OBS → Settings → Output → Recording Quality: anything but "Same as stream", which cannot
   pause.

Then verify, and create the capture scene for the app's window:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/obs.mjs status          # output.canPause must be true
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/obs.mjs setup-scene --window "<part of the window title>" --size 1600x900 --fps 30
```

`setup-scene` changes OBS's scene collection and canvas size — say so before running it on a
machine where OBS is also used for other work. Full guide: `demo-capture/references/obs.md`.

## 6. Final Cut Pro (optional — the hand finish)

Nothing to install beyond FCP itself. `setup.sh` reports the newest FCPXML version it
imports; `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/fcp-templates.mjs` lists the title templates
`meta.fcp` can name. Guide: `demo-assembly/references/final-cut-pro.md`.

## 7. Scaffold (optional)

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/init-demo.sh
```

Creates `demo/` with the brief template, the Remotion project, and gitignore entries.
Idempotent — never overwrites an existing brief, storyboard, or customised studio.

## Report

State plainly what is ready, what is missing, what you installed, and whether a restart is
needed. If the environment is not ready, say which stage of the pipeline would fail.
