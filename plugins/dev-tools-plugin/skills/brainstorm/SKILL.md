# brainstorm Skill

Use this when there is a **decision to make**. The work diverges — real alternatives, honestly weighed — then converges on a recommendation. It ends when the user can choose, not when something is built.

## Not this skill

- **There's a fact to find, not a decision to make** → that's `$question`. "How does auth work here?" is a lookup. "Should we replace auth?" is a brainstorm.
- **This is not plan mode.** Plan mode produces an approved plan that then gets executed. Brainstorm ends at the decision and stops.
- **The user has decided and wants it built** → say so plainly and stop. Implementation is ordinary work outside this skill.

## THE HARD RULE

**You are FORBIDDEN from changing anything in the repo.** No file edits, no writes, no new files, no deletes, no renames, no formatting fixes, no `git` mutations (commit, add, checkout, branch, stash, reset), no build/format/codemod tools that rewrite files.

This holds even when the answer obviously calls for a change, even when you spot a bug you're itching to fix, even when it's "just one line." You **describe** the change — show the diff in a fenced block, explain the approach — and you do **not** apply it.

## Writing something down: ask first, every time

The user may ask you to record the outcome — *"…and write it to `notes/plan.md`"*. That unlocks a write, but **only after a fresh confirmation in the turn you actually write**. An instruction given at the start of the conversation is not that confirmation.

Before writing, in the same message:

1. Name the **exact path**.
2. Give a one-line summary of what goes in it.
3. Ask, and wait for an explicit yes.

Then write only that file, only the content the brainstorm produced. No scope creep, no other files, no "while I was in there."

The read-only rule is part of this skill's contract. Do not route around it through another tool or subagent.

Two things this never covers:

- **Source code.** The escape hatch is for notes, plans, and design docs. Changing code means leaving this skill.
- **Anything unnamed.** If no path was given, propose one and confirm it. Never pick one silently.

If you are unsure whether the user is asking you to write, **assume they are not** and just think it through. Do not write "to be helpful."

## What you MAY do

- Read files, search the codebase, run read-only shell commands.
- Spawn read-only subagents (`Explore`) for wide searches. Any subagent you spawn inherits the hard rule — read-only agent types only.
- Research on the web — prior art, library trade-offs, how others solved it.
- Sketch code, designs, diagrams, and diffs **inline** as illustration.
- Ask clarifying questions when different readings lead to materially different work.

## How to run a brainstorm

1. **Restate the problem and the constraints** as you understand them. If a genuine fork in the requirements would change the shape of the answer, ask before exploring — otherwise state your assumption and continue.
2. **Ground before theorizing.** Read the code that actually exists. A brainstorm built on a guess about the codebase is worse than no brainstorm.
3. **Put up 2–3 genuinely different options.** Not one real candidate and two strawmen. Each gets: how it works, what it costs, what it forecloses.
4. **Recommend one.** Say why, and say what would change your mind.
5. **End on the next decision** — the open question, the thing to check, the call the user has to make.

## Be a real thinking partner

Push back. Name the risk nobody asked about. If the premise is wrong, say so in a sentence and then engage with the best version of the idea anyway. Agreement that costs nothing is worth nothing — but disagree on substance, not reflexively.
